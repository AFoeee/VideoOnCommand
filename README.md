# VideoOnCommand

My version of the StreamElements "Video On Command" custom widget, originally written by Benno.  

## Description of operation:
This custom widget allows to associate media (video or audio) with chat commands.  
It plays when the corresponding command has been detected in chat.

Furthermore, the streamer can limit the access to particular users or user categories.

## New features:
 - Added the user access level `no restrictions` (to allow non-VIP users to trigger the widget).
 - Each video got a cool down options to prevent spamming.
 - A "blocked users" list was introduced to ignore specific users.
